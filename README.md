# Learning Blockchain by Implementing Core Concepts

Blockchain is a vast and complex field, making it challenging for developers to get started. Many of its fundamental conceptsâ€”such as consensus mechanisms, transaction validation, and state managementâ€”are difficult to grasp without direct exposure to their underlying logic. The best way to understand blockchain as a developer is to break down these complex ideas into simplified, hands-on implementations.

> This repository is also used as part of **Protocol Camp**, a Web3 bootcamp in Southeast Asia that focuses on expanding the blockchain ecosystem. Whether you're a participant in the camp or an independent learner, this material will guide you through a structured, hands-on approach to blockchain development. https://protocolcamp.shardlab.com/

<br>

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into two main sections:

- **basics/** - Covers fundamental blockchain concepts and implementations, including core principles and chain-specific exercises for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Aptos, and more

- **advanced/** - Explores deeper blockchain topics beyond the basics, such as advanced consensus mechanisms and scripting engines.

<br>

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shard-lab/protocol-camp.git
   cd protocol-camp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

Now youâ€™re ready to explore, modify, and implement blockchain concepts yourself.

<br>

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v20.x or later
- **TypeScript** v5.6.x or later
- **npm** v10.x or later

This repository is meant to be a hands-on learning resourceâ€”feel free to experiment, break things, and truly _understand_ how blockchain works by building it yourself.
